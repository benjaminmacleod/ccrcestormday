<h1 class="title">Storm Days in CCRCE</h1>
<h2 class="center">Colchester County</h2>

<h1>Hello,</h1>
<p>The CCRCE Storm Day Statistics website is an unofficial collection of cancellations, early dismissals, delayed arrivals, and bussing restrictions from the Colchester region of the Chignecto Central Regional Centre for Education <a href="https://www.ccrce.ca">(CCRCE)</a>.</p>
        
<p>Currently, data is collected using CCRCE's <a href="https://www.ccrce.ca/school_information/cancellations">Inclement Weather Notifications</a>. Historical data was collected using CCRCE's <a href="https://x.com/CCRCE_NS">X (formerly Twitter)</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CCRCE">Facebook</a> accounts.</p>

<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
<p>This website may not be 100% accurate, and was created for educational purposes only. While efforts are/have been made to ensure accuracy, the data was collected manually using search filters.</p>
<p>As this dataset is intended to represent the entirety of the County of Colchester, any cancellations made for an individual school (e.g. power outages) have been omitted.</p>

<h4>Raw Data</h4>
<p>Raw data is collected using Google Sheets. Due to the limitations of embedded content from Google Workspace, only historical snapshots will be posted to this website. The link to all of the live raw data can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hCUFEAX57ncixs3p11Ngrr0l5N8ovPFHKDn9VZAn3rc/view">here</a>. Typically data is added from the Inclement Weather Notifications within 1-3 days.</p>
